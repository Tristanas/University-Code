                <li class="special-li">It will steal your private information and sell it to third-world countries.</li>

                This search engine is awful. Yesterday i was searching for cookies and now my browser is full of them.
                I just wanted to search for tasty cookies and where to buy them. Now I will die hungry. COOOOOKIEEEES!!!

                I recently started using this search engine. I am suprised how I can leave this comment over here. Kudos.
                Other than that this search engine is complete utter trash. Takes 50 seconds to load search results.
                One time, I searched for something, went shopping and results appeared 1 hour after I came back.
