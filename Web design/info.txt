Information technologies:

During the course we learned about various Internet protocols and how to use them:
1. Information formats: JSON and XML.
2. JSON and XML schema - how the structure and meaning of files is described.
3. Xpath - how XML documents (and web pages) can be navigated and analized.
4. Website protocols and technologies: HTML (specialized page definition language) and CSS (define styles for page elements)
5. Javascript and interaction with the DOM - document object model.

During the course we had 4 practical tasks:
1. Describe the same entity via XML and JSON formats (I chose a shopping center)
2. Define the XML and JSON schemas for the entity.
3. Create a webpage, which cointains a specific set of HTML elements and CSS styles.
4. Add interaction to the web page via Javascript and JQuery.

To do:
1. Review the web page tasks,
2. Refactor and translate the XPath bits.
