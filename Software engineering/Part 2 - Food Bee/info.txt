Software engineering part 2:

We learned about the ICONIX software process. 
The course covered:
1. Requirements engineering (user stories for example),
2. Robustness analysis (useful when designing the interface), 
3. Project review, 
4. Project implementation processes (detailed design, software implementation, testing - V model),
5. Project maintenance,
6. Introduction into project management and software lifecycles.

During the practices we implemented our peers project while following the ICONIX process:
1. Requirements review,
2. Preliminary design review (including robustness analysis),
3. Detailed design review,
4. Deployment (implementation).

We worked on a single document in several increments.
