Software engineering part 1.

We learned about the Waterfall process. First comes domain analysis, then requirements engineering, architecture and lastly - software implementation.

In practice we were tasked to design a system following a reversed waterfall:
1. We created a prototype, (java project)
2. Designed the system, (4+1 architecture views)
3. Created a requirements specification, (functional, nonfunctional and interface requirements)
4. Peformed a domain analysis. (SWOT, internal and external business analysis, business processes description and recommended scope of the system)

We were required to renew previously created products (including the prototype) in case we found new entities, unexpected requirements and similar aspects of the system.

Why reversed waterfall?
- So that we would make more mistakes, do more work and understand more clearly the benefits of processes we learned about.
- In reality, we were reluctant to update our previous products, thus our documents may be less comprehensive and precise than required.
