During the course we programmed using mainly C, but at some assignments C++ was an option. The main focus was implementing data structures and functionality related to their handling. Later tasks are based on usage of peers' structures and algorithms while solving a specific problems.

During the process of implementing data structures we were encouraged to track how much time we spend at which parts of the development process. We also were encouraged to track:
i) which functionality we have already created,
ii) how many lines of code it takes,
iii) how much time we spend writing a single line of code on average.
Having gathered enough information we were tasked to predict, how many lines of code would the functionality consist of before actually writing it and, knowing the average time a line takes, how long it would take to write everything. This is a useful skill as it helps you to evaluate whether you can complete a project in a given timeframe.
