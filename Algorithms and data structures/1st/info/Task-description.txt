The first assignment was to implement a data structure called queue, which is a linked-list which has specific functionality available. It is a first-in first-out type of structure, which is manipulated using these functions:
    1) Create empty queue,
    2) Check if the queue is empty,
    3) Check if the queue is full,
    4) Enqueue,
    5) Dequeue,
    6) Get head's value,
    7) Get queue's length,
    8) Delete queue.

The readme is in Lithuanian as it was intended for my peers, who had to use my queue implementation for 3rd or 4th task.
