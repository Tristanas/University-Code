The course consisted of Database basics, introduction into SQL queries, database management and development.

We had the following tasks:
- Design efficient SQL queries to achieve a specific goal (result);
- Design a domain model and database table schema (mine was a flash game website, similar to kongregate);
- Write SQL instructions to create the designed database (create tables with their keys and restrictions, populate them with data, define triggers);
- Implement a few use-cases that include interraction with the created database (multiple choices of language, I chose C with embedded SQL).

To do: add missing queries, schemas and database management instruction files.
