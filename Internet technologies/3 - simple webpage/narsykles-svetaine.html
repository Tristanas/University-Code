    <p>
        Astromenda is an application designed to organize
        your browser by changing your home page, default search engine, and new
        tabs to Astromenda, and its goal (as per publisher) is to make “the web
        more accessible and more efficient, for all users." To protect your
        browser settings in the future download<a href="http://bit.ly/1g79yFM">Web Companion</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>
