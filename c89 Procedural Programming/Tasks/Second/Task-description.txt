The second task was about the usage of arrays. The set of requirements were:
1. The use of functions that return some kind of result.
2. The use of void functions which take in pointer type variables so that their changes aren't temporary.
3. Working with arrays inside of functions.

The task was to create a console application, which requests an integer input n and then n more integer inputs. The application should store input and then print it in a sequence:
a) first, print values between minimum and minimum plus one third of difference between maximum and minimum,
b) then print values higher than the first ones, but lower than minimum plus two thirds of the difference,
c) lastly, print values higher than the second ones including the maximum value.
