	Pros of makefile:
1. Makes compilation easier,
2. Compiles main and function source code separately,

It's a Linux instruction.

	Usage:
1. In the folder where all the source code is, create a file named "makefile"
2. In it write all the compilation instructions.
3. Open terminal in the same folder.
4. Write "make" and press enter. - Linux will search for the "makefile" in this folder and executes it's commands.
5. Given that you've written correct compilation commands and code, the source will compile and return an executable file.
