# University-Code
This is a repository for my previous and current study projects. And there have been various topics: 
 * Procedural Programming (c89), 
 * Computer architecture (assembly, tasm on DOS),
 * Data structures and algorithms (c),
 * Object-oriented programming (java),
 * Applied object-oriented programming (c sharp and .NET framework, check out <https://github.com/dariuskrtn/SafePlace> - it was a team-based assignment),
 * Database management systems (PostgreSQL and some c with embedded SQL),
 * Computer networks (c and other languages, a section of the CCNA course).
 * Software engineering part 1 (design of a system, in practice lectures we created a prototype, design and requirements specification, domain analysis) - check out <https://github.com/TMikna/Project-Man>
 * Software engineering part 2 (ICONIX process, software testing and maintenance basics, introduction into project management and software lifecycles)
 * Internet technologies (XML, JSON, XML schema, Xpath, HTTP, CSS, DOM, JQuery, JavaScript)
 
 Most projects will stay as they were during the assessment. I will return to some projects and improve them either by increasing efficiency, expanding functionality or refactoring.
