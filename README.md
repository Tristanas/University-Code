# University-Code
This is a repository for my previous study projects. Over the semesters we have covered many topics which required us to write code: 

Semester 1:
 * Procedural Programming (c89), 
 * Computer architecture (assembly, tasm on DOS),
 
 Semester 2:
 * Data structures and algorithms (c),
 * Object-oriented programming (java),
 
 Semester 3:
 * Applied object-oriented programming (c# and .NET framework, check out <https://github.com/dariuskrtn/SafePlace> - it was a team-based assignment),
 * Database management systems (PostgreSQL and some c with embedded SQL),
 * Software engineering part 1 (design of a system, Waterfall, Architecture styles) - check out our group project: <https://github.com/TMikna/Project-Man>,
 
 Semester 4:
 * Computer networks (c and other languages, a section of the CCNA course),
 * Software engineering part 2 (ICONIX process, software testing and maintenance basics, introduction into project management and software lifecycles),
 
 Semester 5:
 * Web Programming (XML, JSON, XML schema, Xpath, HTTP, CSS, DOM, JQuery, JavaScript),
 * Logic programming (Prolog statements, queries, structures, algorithms, implementation of prolog),
 * Software design (design patterns, packages and complexity management, more info here <https://github.com/Tristanas/PS-projektavimas>),
 * Numerical methods (implementing mathematical algorithms with Matlab: matrices, interpolation, approximation, linear and differential equations),
 
 Semester 6:
 * Software Development (Software process, technologies, team project source code here <https://github.com/tesa4436/projectmayhem>, personal project here <https://github.com/Tristanas/PSK-TP>),
 * Financial intelligence (Introduction to market concepts, market analysis, portfolio management and trading strategies)
 
 Semester 7:
 * Programming with Windows API (Windows OS overview and application development with c++),
 * Optimization methods (implementing algorithms with Matlab to solve optimization problems),
 * Parallel programming (Open multi-processing, Message passing interface, distributed calculations),
 * Video Game Design and Development (with Unity, team project here: <https://github.com/ManfredasSiu/Voztuvas-GameDev>)

 Most projects will stay as they were during the assessment. I will return to some projects and improve them either by increasing efficiency, expanding functionality or refactoring.
